# Final Project

## Kaggle Challenge

In the final project, teams of students will apply their knowledge of machine learning to a [Kaggle Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com).
You will be reporting on three machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset for the Kaggle Challenge.
In addition you will create an ensemble method that combines at least two methods to predict the solution.
The final project has two parts: a write up (like the homework) and a presentation sharing your unique approach to solving the problem.
The kaggle.com score for each method should be included in your solution write up and presentation.

## Teams

Teams will be made up of three students.
Please find team members you feel you can work well with for this final project.
Each team will work together on this project for the remainder of the quarter.

Please have one member fork the final project repository (<https://gitlab.cs.wallawalla.edu/cptr330/final-project>) and share membership with each member of the group.

## Kaggle Challenge Selection

Each team will pick Kaggle Challenge to working on.

Challenge Criteria:

* The challenge must be open through the end of course and grading (thus June 14, 2021)
* Each group must select a unique challenge (this way each presentation will be on a unique problem)
* The team must get approval for the selected challenge

## Resources

* Kaggle Competitions -- <https://www.kaggle.com/>

## Write Up

1. The machine learning solution shall be written in an R notebook based on the homework template.
    1. Similar to our weekly homework assignments, you will need to show your initial algorithm and the improvements you made.
    1. Include the 5 steps and only repeat 3, 4, and 5 for each approach.
    1. Each team will report on a few machine learning algorithms (the number is based on the team size) plus an ensemble method.
1. Outline and describe your approach for two (or three) machine learning algorithms.
    1. Nearest Neighbors
    1. Naive Bayes
    1. Decision Trees
    1. Rules
    1. Regression
    1. Logistical Regression
    1. Neural Networks
    1. Support Vectors
    1. Association Rules
    1. K-means
    1. Random Forest
1. Create an _ensemble_ algorithm that combines at least two machine learning algorithms.
1. The data files can be downloaded form <http://www.kaggle.com>.

## Presentation

1. Week 10 will be dedicated to teams presenting their work on the Final Project.
1. Each team will have a 15 minute time slot (12 minute presentation and 3 minutes for questions).
1. The presentation should highlight your approach and show your final process used to get the best result.
1. Please watch your time so you do not take up other team's presentation time.
1. Be prepared with your presentation when you are up to present.
1. Every team is working with a different dataset, make sure to give a clear background on the problem and what lead you to your best solution.
1. Highlight your unique parameters and approaches.
1. The Kaggle score for each solution should be included as part of the presentation.
1. Remember, this is a presentation, not a walk-through your written report. Please format the information into a nice presentation (probably with slides).

## Submission

Your submission will include two parts: a R notebook and presentation.
D2L will have two separate submissions for these files.
